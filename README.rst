======

ecl2df is a wrapper around libecl and sunbeam for accessing Eclipse
(reservoir simulator from Schlumberger) output and input as 
Pandas DataFrames.

flow from OPM is also using the same file formats, and will work
as long as libecl works.

This software is (currently) internal to Equinor ASA and shall not be 
shared externally.
